Kafka SSL files are expected in a directory named kafka-ssl contained in the cwd (current working directory) when the server is started.

The required files are:
- ca-cert.pem (CA certificate)
- webui-cert.pem (certificate)
- webui-priv-key.pem (private key)
- key-password.txt (private key passphrase)
